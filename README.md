#### **I'm a self-taught developer looking to start a career creating online apps and services.**


Hello, my name is Haitham, and for a long time I've been captivated with the concept of constructing anything from scratch or fixing it, and if I didn't know how¬†I'd keep trying to figure it out. I'm passionate about the big picture down to the pixel ,so programming has been a  natural match for me.

During the quarantine, I had the opportunity to focus on it and improve my life. When I first started learning programming, I became intrigued with backend development using (.NET) and the C# language, so my goal is to learn more and more about backend web development and eventually enter the field.

:mortar_board:	I have a bachelor's degree in business administration , 4 years of experience working in the real estate industry and 
6 month as a Dispatch - Logistics Coordinator in the freight pick up/delivery industry.
